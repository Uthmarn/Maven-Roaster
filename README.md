# Maven-Roaster
Sales Dashboard, Maven Roasters New York 2023.
I completed the Maven Roasters, a fictitious coffee shop, Sales Dashboard, using Powerbi and Excel. This project summarizes the Total revenues, it also visualizes the insight on the Number of product type offered, Sales by time, Sales by location, Sales by product category and Sales by day of week including slicers for Month, location and product type, time and product category.

It is observed that there is a rush sales during the early hours of the day and this is as a result of most communters going to respective places of work in the morning.

On the Sales by day of week chart, Monday seems to be the busiest day because it's believed to be a productive day and high percentage of employed population resumes office duties on the first day of the week.

Barista espresso takes the highest number sales and the least goes to Green beans. This is based on preferences from the buyers and it shows high percentage of buyers enjoys Barista espresso. 

In the data model, the store id columnn shows a many to many relationship between Sales and Location table, the location id column shows a one to one relationship between the Sales and Calendar table and product id column shows a many to many relationship between the Sales and Product Table.
